          HomeAlone is a web-app prototype developed by a brilliant team of enthusiasts who came together to provide a digital sotulion to problems related to the Corona crisis. The app was brought live over the course of 48 hours as part of WirvsVirus Hackathon staged by the Federal German government. It aims to provide help to people living alone in lockdown by encouraging activities that help to maintain mental wellbeing and physical health.

<p>The Federal German Government called for a two-day online hackathon in mid-March and received an overwhelming response rate of 40,000 initial participants out of which 28,361 people got actively involved and developed 1,500 solutions to fight against the Corona crisis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“ With over 28,000 participants: we have set up the world’s largest hackathon. ”, as Chancellery Minister Helge Braun emphasized./</p>

<h3 id="investigating-problems">Investigating problems</h3>
<p>/<em>All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication.</em>/</p>
<p>Our team identified that the 2019–20 <em>coronavirus</em> pandemic and the resulting isolation as well as social distancing pose unprecedented challenge on people’s mental and emotional wellbeing. Especially those living in one person households: older people living alone, divorced people living alone, and single parents tend to face the most difficult times.</p>
<p>Through research, we identified a sample of problems that people living alone struggle with during COVID-19 lockdown:</p>
<ol>
<li>Managing moments of intense stress or anxiety, loneliness.</li>
<li>Facing both physical and mental blocks that affect everyday lifestyle.</li>
<li>Loosing connection to family and friends.</li>
<li>Feeling out of balance with daily routine.</li>
</ol>
<p>Knowing this information helped us frame design opportunity spaces that people can benefit from and stay more optimistic and engaged during tough times.</p>
<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
<p>Before starting to develop the project, we wanted to set a series of objectives that we wanted to achieve, to keep them in mind throughout the process:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduce the lack of social contact</strong> and <strong>isolation</strong>, that is, encourage people to get in “contact” with one another by means of technology, hand-written letters and sources of attention.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on holistic health</strong> and <strong>social interaction</strong>  by providing a place where people can be part of the community.</li>
<li><strong>Keep the community physically and mentally fit</strong>, to promote their creativity, to let them discover new hobbies or to allow them to become artistically active, to learn new languages, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Boost mood and mental wellbeing</strong> through engaging content.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="project-scope--mvp">Project Scope &amp; MVP</h3>
<p>Thanks to several project scope meetings it was agreed to deliver MVP in the form of a web-app as part of German Hackathon program against COVID-19.  The product had to be built over the course of 48 hours with online collaboration only. Thanks to this approach we could deliver a working prototype which received support and appreciation and was selected in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYGe9q9_Jo3CAiufkVFqHj0yKrWrW7uVq">one of the 191 best in the hackathon</a>  among 1150 other submissions.</p>
<h3 id="research--ai-information-architecture">Research &amp; AI (information architecture)</h3>
<p>Before implementing the idea at Hackathon, we followed a series of <em>research methodologies</em> that helped us fully immerse ourselves in the subject matter and problem we were facing. Thanks to the use of this type of tools we can save time and money, since they allow us to validate or not ideas before they are implemented.</p>
<h5 id="competition">Competition</h5>
<p>The first thing that was done was an <em>analysis of</em> direct and indirect <em>competition</em> in order to understand the environment in which we were entering, with the aim of seeking good and bad practices within the sector. Thanks to this method we can detect pain points in other products and patterns, which in the future will help us build our own product.</p>

<h5 id="survey-polls">Survey Polls</h5>
<p>Through surveys, we can obtain <em>quantitative</em> data about what users think about the subject we are dealing with.</p>
<p>A survey was launched using different digital communication channels such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and LinkedIn, resulting in 70 responses in total.</p>

<h5 id="user-persona">User Persona</h5>
<p>Thanks to several conducted interviews with volunteers and data from the poll, we created <em>archetypes,</em> which represent the different groups of profiles of potential users of the product. These allow us to validate some decisions.</p>
<p>In this case we decided to create two, <em>Molly</em> , single woman who recently broke up with her boyfriend and now lives alone in a studio flat. On the other hand there is <em>John</em> , a  father and grandpa who lives alone in the countryside while his son and family live in the city.</p>

<h5 id="affinity-diagram">Affinity Diagram</h5>
<p>In order to showcase some information obtained during the Research phase, we decided to make an <strong>Affinity Diagram</strong>, thanks to which we can organize all the data, ideas and perceptions obtained during the research, grouping them by categories or similarities.</p>

<p>Once the Hackathon was over, we grouped into a smaller group of enthusiasts willing to continue working on the product. I volunteered to continue developing UX/UI for the app.
I took my initial prototype 0.1 and rebooted it with a new structure and in-app architecture.</p>

<p>Social presence in digital apps implies that people feel more engaged when they feel the presence of other human beings through the screens.</p>
<p>HomeAlone brings this presence by showcasing motivational stories, or suggesting collaborative challenges in your area. It also allows to connect with other user or share the app to a friend.</p>
